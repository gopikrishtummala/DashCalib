# DashCalib
This repo contains the code snippets for initial implementation of the DashCalib paper. 
The code is 3 years old and based on the multiple requests I am sharing the prototype code. I will clean-up the code at slow pace. 
Some pieces of original code are (written latter in C++ for device integrations) are not shared as it has pieces from old projects which are proprietary.
