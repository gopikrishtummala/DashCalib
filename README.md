# DashCalib
This repo contains the code snippets for initial implementation of the DashCalib paper. 
The code is 3 years old. Based on the multiple requests, I am sharing the old prototype code. 
I will clean-up the code at slow pace. Some pieces of original code (written more formally latter in C++ for device integrations) are not shared as it has pieces from old projects which are proprietary.
